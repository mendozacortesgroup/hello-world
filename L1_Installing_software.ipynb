You may need to enter your password to unlock the settings page.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Download __[the Octave 3.8.0 installer](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_macOS)__ or the latest version that isn't 4.0.0. The file is large so this may take some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Open the downloaded image, probably named GNU_Octave_3.8.0-6.dmg on your computer, and then open Octave-3.8.0-6.mpkg inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Follow the installer’s instructions. You may need to enter the administrator password for your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After the installer completes, Octave should be installed on your computer. You can find Octave-cli in your Mac’s Applications, which is a text interface for Octave that you can use to complete Machine Learning’s programming assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Octave also includes an experimental graphical interface which is called Octave-gui, also in your Mac’s Applications, but we recommend using Octave-cli because it’s more stable.\n",
    "\n",
